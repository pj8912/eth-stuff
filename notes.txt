EVM

The Ethereum Virtual Machine is the global virtual computer whose state every participant on the Ethereum network stores and agrees on. Any participant can request the execution of arbitrary code on the EVM; code execution changes the state of the EVM. https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/

Any participant can broadcast a request for this computer to perform arbitrary computation. Whenever such a request is broadcast, other participants on the network verify, validate, and carry out ("execute") the computation. This execution causes a state change in the EVM, which is committed and propagated throughout the entire network.

Requests for computation are called transaction requests; the record of all transactions and the EVM's present state gets stored on the blockchain, which in turn is stored and agreed upon by all nodes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Any participant who broadcasts a transaction request must also offer some amount of ETH to the network as a bounty. The network will award this bounty to 
whoever eventually does the work of verifying the transaction, executing it, committing it to the blockchain, and broadcasting it to the network.

Smart Contracts:
If we want request EVM for computation we do not have to write code every time. The developers upload programs into EVM state, and users make requests to execute these code snippets with varying parameters.

Anyone can create smart contract and make it public to the network, using the blockchain as its data layer, for a fee paid in the network. Anyone can call the smart contract to execute its code, again for a fee paid to the network.

Visibility Modifiers: control access to variables and functions

these are made use by keywords

state variables have three Visibility Modifiers:
	- public 
	- internal
	- private
external keyword is not applicable to state variables

functions have:
	- external
	- public
	- internal
	- private
